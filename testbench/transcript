#                      non-compliant behavior, where the kind always defaults

#   -tbxhvllint[=<fileName>][+ignorepkgs[=[[<lib1>.]<pkg1>]...[,[<libN>.]<pkgN>]]]
#                      The -tbxhvllint switch causes the compiler to warn about delays found in the source
#                      code that may cause synchronization issues in Veloce TBX.
#                      NOTE: If you plan to use vsim's -tbxhvllint switch to extract run time delay
#                      ----- information then you must use this switch with the compiler.
#                      - The #delay warnings may be captured in the optional file <fileName>.
#                      - Additionally, the switch '+ignorepkgs' allows you to suppress #delay warnings from
#                        imported packages. The '+ignorepkgs' without any arguments will suppress warnings
#                        related to all #delays found in all the imported packages. You may fine tune the
#                        message suppression by specifying package names (with optional library names). For
#                        example '-tbxhvllint+ignorepkgs=uvm_pkg' will cause messages related to #delays
#                        found in any package named 'uvm_pkg' (regardless of the library). Specifying
#                        '-tbxhvllint+ignorepkgs=mylib.mypkg' will suppress #delay messages related to
#                        imported package 'mypkg' from library 'mylib'.
#                      - Multiple '-tbxhvllint' switches are allowed.
#   -timescale[=]<timescale>
#                      Specify the default timescale for modules not having an
#                      explicit timescale. The format of <timescale> is the same
#                      as that of the `timescale directive.
#                      For example, -timescale "1 ns / 1 ps".
#   -override_timescale[=]<timescale>
#                      Override the timescale specified in the source code.
#   -override_precision
#                      Override the precision of timescale specified in the source code.
#   +typdelays         Use typical timing from min:typ:max expressions
#   -s                 Do not load the std package.
#   -u                 Convert regular Verilog identifiers to uppercase
#   -v <path>          Specify Verilog source library file
#   -vv                Print auto C/C++ compile/link subprocess command line information
#   -vlog95compat      Ensure compatibility with Std 1364-1995
#   -vlog01compat      Ensure compatibility with Std 1364-2001
#   -convertallparams  Enables converting parameters not defined in ANSI style
#                      to VHDL generics of type std_logic_vector, bit_vector,
#                      std_logic and bit.
#   -mixedsvvh [b | s | v] [packedstruct]
#                      Facilitates using SV packages at the SV-VHDL mixed-language boundary.
#                         b - treat scalars/vectors in package as bit/bit_vector
#                         s - treat scalars/vectors in package as std_logic/std_logic_vector
#                         v - treat scalars/vectors in package as vl_logic/vl_logic_vector
#                         packedstruct - treat packed structures as VHDL arrays of equivalent size
#   -y <path>          Specify Verilog source library directory
#   -vmake             Collects complete list of command line args and files processed for use by vmake.
#   -writetoplevels <fileName>
#                      Writes complete list of toplevels into <fileName> (also includes the name specified
#                      with -cuname). The file <fileName> can be used with vopt command's -f switch.
