**2. /src FOLDER**

- Contains source code verilog of RC4 algorithm including:
    +   RC4 generate 4 bits / clock in both KSA sub-stage and PRGA.
    +   RC4 generate N byte / clock in PRGA stage by adding 1 read-port to SBox with N * 8 width.
    +   RC4 generate 16 bits / 2 clock using new method in both KSA and PRGA (developing).

-   In each sub-folder in src, It contains:
    +   rc4.v: main code of the RC4 algorithm
    +   *_tb.v: testbench code for each method.
    +   rc4_inst.v: use for running on FPGA board (In this project, we use DE2-115 EP4CE115F29C7).
    +   ram.v: contains code to generate SBox of the RC4 algorithm.

**3. /test FOLDER**

- Contains files for generating and evaluating the results.
    +   matlab sub-folder: contains matlab code. It gets input data (number of secret key bytes and secret key)
                            and return result to output.txt file.
    +   c sub-folder: contains c code for verify result. (for reference, you may only use matlab enough).
    +   modelsim: contains a file name `run_sim.tcl` to auto run modelsim with full signal and a work folder is 
                    workspace of modelsim.

**4. AUTORUN FILES**

-   In this project we add 2 autorun file. 
    +   `git_update.sh`: use for update code to github with the 
        commit content in the "". For example, run `.\git_update.sh "update code to github"` will push your code to github
        with note: "update code to github".
    +   `autorun_test.sh`: use for running test automatically. When start, it runs matlab to call rc4.m script to generate 
        output and after that run modelsim to verify output from matlab. If success, it return data correct notation.
    
**5. HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT**

-   If you want to open project in Quartus, you need to start Quartus software and open file rc4.qpf.

-   Run matlab code. Open matlab and link to matlab sub-folder in RC4 project. Test input is in
    `RC4/test/data/input.txt`. After running code, result is written to output.txt in the same folder `/data`.

-   Start modelsim and do the following steps:
    +   In modelsim windows. `Choose File --> Open --> RC4.`
    +   Compile All file .v
    +   Simulation --> Start simulation.
    +   Select signal --> Add to waves/ Ctrl + W.
    +   In command windows, type `run 10us`.

-   If command windows show # data correct, that mean your verilog code is completely correct with matlab.
    Otherwise, It will show which bytes were wrong. 

**If you want to execute test with 1 step. Open command windows and run command `.\autorun_test.sh`. If will do all above step
    and show result in command windows. If you want to view waveform, just type: `vsim -view vsim.wlf`.**
